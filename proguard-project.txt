# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.

# For more details, see

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}


# Specifies not to generate mixed-case class names while obfuscating. By default, obfuscated class names can contain a mix of upper-case characters and lower-case characters. This creates perfectly acceptable and usable jars. Only if a jar is unpacked on a platform with a case-insensitive filing system (say, Windows), the unpacking tool may let similarly named class files overwrite each other. Code that self-destructs when it's unpacked! Developers who really want to unpack their jars on Windows can use this option to switch off this behavior. Obfuscated jars will become slightly larger as a result. Only applicable when obfuscating.

#Specifies to write out some more information during processing. If the program terminates with an exception, this option will print out the entire stack trace, instead of just the exception message.
